# 👁️ Dislock

Discord interactions bot that collects "infraction" / tardiness data via a modal and buttons, and writes/updates rows in a Google Sheet.

Useful for gathering evidence and being smug when your friends say they're 5 minutes away from starting a game of Deadlock but for some reason take longer than 5 minutes.

Currently deployed via a DigitalOcean Droplet, using Nginx & PM2.
